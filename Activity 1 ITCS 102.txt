Hi, I am Drake louise A. Cruz, student from the BSIT First Year 

This is my first file  in my REPO 

About Me: Hi! I’m someone who’s passionate about all things fast and fun. I love playing video games, especially ones that challenge my skills and spark my imagination. I’m also into cars—whether it's learning about engines, designs, or just admiring a well built ride. On top of that, I’m a big fan of Vinduro motorcycles. There's just something about vintage enduro bikes that combines style, history, and adventure all in one. Whether I’m gaming or getting my hands greasy, I’m always up for something exciting.
